## Sensor Configuration

This sensor suite is built upon **[rclUE](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/rclUE/tree/UE5_devel_humble)** and **[RapyutaSimulationPlugins](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/RapyutaSimulationPlugins/tree/devel)** to deliver a versatile and adjustable sensor array, simulating sensors and autonomous systems in **Unreal Engine 5.1** using **ROS2 Humble** on **Ubuntu 22.04**. The FLIR sensor was implemented to the ROS2 by implementing the method described by **Vemulapalli et al. (2023)** [full reference below](#reference).

### Virtual Sensor Suite
The virtual setup includes the following sensors:  
- **GPS**: Simulated GPS for positioning and navigation.  
- **IMU**: Provides heading and orientation data.  
- **LiDAR**: High-resolution Ouster LiDAR for obstacle detection and environmental mapping.  
- **Depth Camera**: Enables depth perception for object recognition and obstacle avoidance.  
- **RGB Camera**: Captures high-quality visual data for scene analysis.  
- **FLIR Camera**: Simulates thermal imaging for advanced perception in various environments.  
- **Contact Sensors**: Detect physical interaction with objects in the environment.  
- **3D LiDAR**: Simulates full-range 3D mapping capabilities.  
- **2D LiDAR**: Provides planar mapping and obstacle detection.  
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Simulate short-range distance measurements.  
- **Radar**: Detects objects using radio waves, ideal for poor visibility conditions.
